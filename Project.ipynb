    "AirBnB is a company that allows owners of properties to rent them out to other individuals. It has expanded tremendously since launching 11 years ago, while at the same time triggering some controversy. Critics of AirBnB have alleged that excessive rentals of properties have helped tourists at the expense of residents who face difficulties in finding accomodation.\n",

    "The business purpose of analyzing AirBnB data would be to find out whether certain patterns are present in typical rentals. One could investigate what tends to drive prices up, and what tends to drive them down. Other possible business factgors could involve the length of rentals, the reviews typically given to properties, or the amenities they offer. "
